This SQL project was my first project in SQL.  I really enjoyed using this platform as most of my practice had been with Python in VS code. I felt like my previous practice set me up for success in this project.  Writing queries in SQL was very intuitive for this project.  I could see exactly what information I needed to query and knew how I wanted to code to find the information. 

Some project observations:
I think a successful rental in this market would have to have the best combination of location, price, and availability. As seen in Problem 8, 
just because a neighborhood has a high number of listings does not necessarily mean it is successful.  You could even analyze what room type
renters preferred as some people may choose an entire home/apt over a private room despite other factors such as cost.
